# SITUATIONS

The project [SITUATIONS](http://situations.dergreif-online.de/) is a cooperation between [DERGREIF](http://situations.dergreif-online.de/) and the [FOTOMUSEUM WINTERTHUR](https://www.fotomuseum.ch/de/) on 10/16/2016. It addresses the topics metadata, photography and WorldWideWeb.

The concept consists of a website and three installations at the Fotomuseum Winterthur. The idea is a chain letter process to publish photos from a photo library and retrieve metadata such as age, geolocation, purpose, profession, etc. in return on the website. The selected photos and metadata are published online via a gallery. In the exhibition at the Fotomuseum Winterthur the metadata is read out by a computer which you can listen to using headphones. Furthermore the metadata of the different publishers geolocation is shown on a digital map and the personal metadata is visualized in graphs on a screen. The technical implementation of the project was realized by [MICHAEL SCHWARZ](https://github.com/schwamic) and [SEBASTIAN OLEY](https://github.com/bddy).
